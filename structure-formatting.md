## Review Structure Guidance

Adaptable guidance for organizing review content based on product complexity:

## Section Selection Decision Guide

Use this decision guide to determine which sections to include in your review based on the specific product and information gathered.

### Core Sections
The following sections are typically included in most reviews:

**Introduction/Hook**
- ✅ Include for virtually all products to establish context and engagement
- ❌ Consider minimal version only if product is extremely technical with no narrative potential

**Experience/Usage**
- ✅ Include for all products where actual usage experience exists
- ❌ Consider minimal version only for products that are purely technical with no meaningful usage experience

**Pros & Cons (Evaluation)**
- ✅ Include for virtually all products to provide clear assessment
- ❌ Consider integrating into other sections only if advantages/limitations are minimal

**Conclusion/Verdict**
- ✅ Include for virtually all products to provide clear recommendation
- ❌ Consider minimal version only if verdict is extremely obvious from preceding sections

### Conditional Sections
The following sections should be selectively included based on specific criteria:

**Technical Details**
- ✅ Include if: Product has important specifications, materials, or performance metrics
- ✅ Include if: Technical aspects significantly impact purchase decisions
- ❌ Skip if: Product is extremely simple with few technical aspects worth mentioning
- ❌ Skip if: Technical details are fully covered within experience narrative for very simple products

**Audience/Ideal Users**
- ✅ Include if: Product is well-suited for specific user groups but not others
- ✅ Include if: Product has clear strengths for certain scenarios but weaknesses for others
- ❌ Skip if: Product is universally applicable with no specific audience differentiation
- ❌ Skip if: Ideal and non-ideal users are fully covered in pros/cons without needing elaboration

**Practical Advice**
- ✅ Include if: You've discovered non-obvious tips through extended use
- ✅ Include if: Product has learning curve or special maintenance requirements
- ✅ Include if: You've found workarounds for limitations
- ❌ Skip if: Product is intuitive with no special insights to share
- ❌ Skip if: Usage advice is completely covered in the experience narrative

### Custom Sections
Consider creating custom sections when standard options don't adequately address key product aspects:

**When to create custom sections:**
- ✅ Create when: A specific aspect is crucial to the purchase decision but doesn't fit well in standard sections
- ✅ Create when: Grouping related information would significantly improve clarity
- ✅ Create when: The product has unique characteristics that deserve focused attention

**Examples of effective custom sections:**
- Sound Quality (audio products)
- Color & Finish Variations (aesthetic products)
- Fit & Comfort (wearable products)
- Installation Experience (products requiring setup)
- Sustainability Features (eco-focused products)

Use this decision guide during the planning phase to determine which sections will provide the most value for your specific product. Remember that including only relevant sections creates a more focused, helpful review than forcing content into unnecessary sections.
### Structure Principles

- Structure serves the product experience, not the other way around
- Organize content to prioritize what readers need most
- Word count should reflect information value, not arbitrary targets

### Product Complexity Considerations

#### Simpler Products
- Typically range from 800-900 words but can vary
- Value often comes from depth of testing rather than breadth of features

#### Moderate Complexity Products
- Typically range from 900-1100 words but can vary

#### Complex Products
- Typically range from 1100-1200 words but can vary


## Standard Section Types

### Introduction/Hook
**Purpose**: Create immediate engagement and establish authenticity
**Content elements**:
- Specific incident or experience with the product
- Problem-solution context if applicable
- Initial thematic elements if using a thematic approach

**Example**:
*"I heard the clink from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood. Standard glass-breakage scenario initiated: broom deployment, dustpan maneuvers, followed by tactical tweezer operations for rogue foot-shard extraction."*

### Experience/Usage
**Purpose**: Provide authentic usage context and practical insights
**Content elements**:
- Specific usage scenarios in real-world context
- Unexpected discoveries or applications
- Integration into daily routines

**Example**:
*"The surviving cup found its calling under my espresso machine. That pour spout? Actually understands fluid dynamics - directing my precious caffeine without the usual counter splatter. But here's the real discovery: fill one past the final 70ml marking, and you've got the perfect kernel load for a Chinese popcorn cannon."*

### Technical Details
**Purpose**: Present specifications and performance details
**Content elements**:
- Key measurements and specifications
- Material composition and quality
- Technical performance metrics

**Example**:
*"The 70ml capacity features dual measurement systems (oz/ml) clearly marked on both sides. The borosilicate glass provides excellent heat resistance up to 500°F, making it safe for hot liquids and microwave use."*

### Pros & Cons (Evaluation)
**Purpose**: Assess strengths and limitations
**Content elements**:
- Key advantages with specific details
- Limitations or drawbacks with context
- Personality enhancement on 30-40% of items

**Example**:
*"Advantages:*
*• Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses*
*• Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)*
*• Pour spout that actually works*

*Limitations:*
*- Fragile as my ego after someone criticizes my coffee technique*
*- Glass thickness suggests it was designed for a gentler universe"*

### Audience/Ideal Users
**Purpose**: Help readers self-identify whether product meets their needs
**Content elements**:
- Specific user profiles or scenarios
- Usage contexts where product excels
- Situations where product underperforms

**Example**:
*"Ideal for:*
*• Coffee enthusiasts needing precise measurements*
*• Recipe developers working with small amounts*

*Less suitable for:*
*- Households with young kids (fragile glass)*
*- Anyone cooking primarily large-batch recipes"*

### Practical Advice
**Purpose**: Provide actionable guidance from personal experience
**Content elements**:
- Discoveries not in product documentation
- Workarounds for limitations
- Maintenance or longevity advice

**Example**:
*"Helpful tips:*
*• Keep the box for storage - these aren't drawer-rummaging tools*
*• Perfect for pour-over coffee measurements*
*• Use with a scale for ultimate kitchen science"*

### Conclusion/Verdict
**Purpose**: Provide clear recommendation and purchase guidance
**Content elements**:
- Summary of key value proposition
- Price-value assessment
- Final recommendation with context

**Example**:
*"At $9 for two, they're solid tools for kitchen precision - just maybe keep one in a protective bunker as backup. Perfect for coffee enthusiasts, careful measurers, and anyone who's muttered \"but how much is a 'splash' exactly?\" while cooking."*

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headers and Section Markers
- Use decorative title formatting: ********** [TITLE] **********
- Create section headers with symbol prefixes: >> SECTION NAME
- Format PROS with asterisks: * Advantage description
- Format CONS with hyphens: - Limitation description
- Limit decorative elements to 15 characters for mobile compatibility

### Paragraph Structure
- Keep paragraphs brief (3-5 sentences) for scannability
- Use horizontal dividers (---------------) between major sections
- Ensure proper spacing for visual separation
- Front-load paragraphs with key information
- Follow with personality elements as appropriate

### List Formatting
- Use bullet points for positive attributes (*)
- Use hyphens for negative attributes (-)
- Keep list items concise (15 words or fewer when possible)
- Start with clear information
- Add personality to 30-40% of items (after information)

### Mobile Optimization
- Avoid extremely long paragraphs (5+ sentences)
- Limit run-on sentences (aim for 20 words or fewer)
- Use clear spacing between sections
- Ensure list formatting displays properly on small screens
- Keep decorative elements minimal for faster loading

## Sentence Structure

Guidance for creating readable, engaging sentence structures:

### Sentence Length Guidance

- Prioritize shorter sentences (under 20 words) for most content
  - Shorter sentences improve readability and comprehension
  - Example: "The battery lasts eight hours. This exceeds most competitors in this price range."

- Limit complex sentences to 27 words or fewer when possible
  - Longer sentences become difficult to process, especially on mobile devices
  - Example: "While the sound quality doesn't match premium headphones costing three times as much, these deliver impressive clarity and bass response that punches above their price point."

- Intersperse complex sentences with shorter, simpler ones
  - Creates natural rhythm and gives readers processing breaks
  - Example: "The case charges quickly via USB-C. When fully charged, it provides an additional 24 hours of listening time, which meant I only needed to plug it in twice during a week-long business trip."

### Implementation Techniques

#### Sentence Sandwiching
Place complex sentences between simpler ones for better flow

Example: "The headphones arrived in minimal packaging. Despite the environmentally-friendly approach to packaging, which uses recycled cardboard and plant-based ink without excess plastic, everything inside was perfectly protected during shipping. Setup took less than two minutes."

#### Purposeful Fragmentation
Strategic use of sentence fragments for emphasis or rhythm

Example: "Battery life is exceptional. Truly outstanding. I got 10 hours of continuous use before needing a recharge."

#### Complex-to-Simple Clarification
Follow complex information with simple summary statements

Example: "The active noise cancellation uses advanced digital signal processing that samples ambient noise 1000 times per second to create precisely calibrated counter-frequencies that neutralize background sounds across multiple frequency ranges. Simply put: it makes noisy environments silent."

### Section-Specific Considerations

#### Technical Details
- Use more simple sentences to ensure specifications are easily understood
- Example: "The headphones weigh 7.2 ounces. They include 40mm drivers. The frequency response ranges from 20Hz to 22kHz."

#### Experience Narrative
- Greater variety in sentence structure to create engaging flow
- Example: "The touch controls work perfectly. When wearing gloves during a snowy hike, however, I found myself repeatedly tapping with increasing frustration before giving up and pulling out my phone to change tracks manually."

#### Pros and Cons
- Keep list items concise with minimal complexity

### Common Pitfalls

#### Sentence Bloat
Adding too many clauses and ideas to a single sentence

**Problematic**: "These headphones have impressive battery life that lasts for 8 hours of continuous use even at higher volumes and with noise cancellation enabled, which is perfect for long flights or workdays, and they also recharge quickly in just 15 minutes for an additional 2 hours of listening time."

**Improved**: "These headphones offer an impressive 8-hour battery life, even with noise cancellation enabled. They also recharge quickly—just 15 minutes provides an additional 2 hours of listening time."

#### Monotonous Structure
Using the same sentence pattern repeatedly

**Problematic**: "The headphones are lightweight. The sound quality is excellent. The battery life is impressive. The design is attractive."

**Improved**: "These lightweight headphones deliver excellent sound while maintaining an impressive battery life. The attractive design doesn't hurt either."

#### Conjunction Overload
Overusing 'and' and 'but' to connect ideas

**Problematic**: "The bass is powerful and the mids are clear and the highs are crisp but sometimes they can be a bit sharp and this might bother some listeners."

**Improved**: "The powerful bass complements clear mids and crisp highs. However, the occasional sharpness in the higher frequencies might bother some listeners."

## Information-Personality Balance

Framework for balancing informational content and personality in reviews:

### Baseline Ratios
- 50% informational content
- 45% personality elements
- 5% flexibility

### Section-Specific Adjustments
- Opening/Introduction Content: +5% personality
- Experience Narrative Content: No adjustment (baseline)
- Technical/Specification Content: -15% personality
- Evaluation Content: -10% personality
- Conclusion/Verdict Content: +5% personality

### Front-Loading Implementation
Always place essential information FIRST in every sentence or list item

**Bad example**: "Like upgrading from economy to business class, this battery charges quickly"
**Good example**: "This battery charges in under 2 hours, like upgrading from economy to business class"

### Section Balance Checkpoints

For each section, verify the personality balance:

#### Introduction Section
- Target: 55% personality / 45% information
- Essential information must be present in first paragraph
- Personality can lead as long as context is established early

#### Technical Section
- Target: 35% personality / 65% information
- Front-load each paragraph with specifications
- Add personality elements only after core information
- Keep technical specifications clear and unobstructed by personality elements

#### Evaluation/Lists Section
- Target: 40% personality / 60% information
- Enhance 30-40% of list items with personality (after information)
- Keep remaining items straightforward and purely informational
- Ensure personality never obscures the evaluation content

#### Conclusion Section
- Target: 55% personality / 45% information
- Lead with value assessment and clear recommendation
- Follow with personality elements that reinforce the recommendation
- End with concrete guidance for potential buyers
