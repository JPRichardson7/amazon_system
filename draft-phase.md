# Draft Creation Phase

## Phase Overview

The Draft Creation phase transforms gathered information into a well-structured review that balances informative content with engaging personality. This phase applies strategic planning to ensure consistent implementation of all framework elements.

**Critical Requirement**: Complete all pre-writing planning before beginning the actual draft. Planning ensures consistent implementation of all framework elements.

## Objectives

- Create a complete, polished review draft that reflects the gathered information
- Apply appropriate structure and formatting for maximum readability
- Balance informational content with engaging personality
- Integrate strategic keywords naturally throughout the content
- Implement creative techniques that enhance without obscuring information

## Pre-Writing Planning

Essential preparation steps that must be completed before drafting begins:

1. **Select appropriate review structure based on product complexity**
   - Choose from simple, standard, or complex structure templates
   - Adapt section organization based on product category
   - Identify product-specific sections that may be needed

2. **Determine personality/information balance targets for each section**
   - Assign specific ratio targets to each planned section
   - Adjust based on content purpose and product category
   - Document targets to guide drafting

4. **Select creative techniques appropriate for the product**
   - Choose thematic approach if applicable
   - Identify opportunities for narrative elements
   - Plan sensory details to enhance product description
   - Plan specific humor techniques for each section

5. **Pre-select list items for personality enhancement**
   - Identify which 30-40% of list items will receive enhancement
   - Focus on the most distinctive or important features
   - Plan enhancement style that complements each feature

## Review Structure Guidance

Adaptable guidance for organizing review content based on product complexity:

### Structure Principles

- Structure should serve the product experience, not the other way around
- Adapt sections based on what matters most for the specific product
- Include only sections that add genuine value to potential buyers
- Organize content to prioritize what readers need most
- Word count should reflect information value, not arbitrary targets

### Product Complexity Considerations

**Simpler products:**
- May require fewer sections with more focused content
- Often benefit from highlighting specific use cases
- Typically range from 800-900 words but can vary
- Value often comes from depth of testing rather than breadth of features

**Moderate complexity products:**
- Often benefit from a balance of experiential and technical content
- May warrant dedicated sections for specific feature sets
- Typically range from 900-1100 words but can vary
- Usually benefit from clearly identified ideal use cases

**Complex products:**
- May require more detailed testing documentation
- Often benefit from comparative analysis with alternatives
- Typically range from 1100-1200 words but can vary
- Usually warrant more extensive technical assessment

### Common Section Types

- **Introduction/hook**: Engaging opening based on experience
- **Usage experience**: Real-world application scenarios
- **Technical aspects**: Specifications and performance details
- **Strengths assessment**: Advantages with specific context
- **Limitations assessment**: Drawbacks with specific context
- **Comparative insights**: Contrasts with alternatives
- **Ideal usage scenarios**: Best applications for the product
- **Practical advice**: Tips discovered through experience
- **Value assessment**: Price-to-performance evaluation
- **Final recommendation**: Overall assessment and guidance

## Content Section Purposes

Each section of the review serves a specific purpose:

### Introduction Section
**Purpose**: Create immediate engagement and establish authenticity
**Content elements**: Specific incident or experience with the product, problem-solution context

**Example**:
*"I heard the clink from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood. Standard glass-breakage scenario initiated: broom deployment, dustpan maneuvers, followed by tactical tweezer operations for rogue foot-shard extraction."*

### Experience/Usage Section
**Purpose**: Provide authentic usage context and practical insights
**Content elements**: Specific usage scenarios, unexpected discoveries, integration into routines

**Example**:
*"The surviving cup found its calling under my espresso machine. That pour spout? Actually understands fluid dynamics - directing my precious caffeine without the usual counter splatter. But here's the real discovery: fill one past the final 70ml marking, and you've got the perfect kernel load for a Chinese popcorn cannon."*

### Technical Section
**Purpose**: Present specifications and performance details
**Content elements**: Key measurements, material composition, technical performance metrics

**Example**:
*"The 70ml capacity features dual measurement systems (oz/ml) clearly marked on both sides. The borosilicate glass provides excellent heat resistance up to 500°F, making it safe for hot liquids and microwave use."*

### Evaluation Section
**Purpose**: Assess strengths and limitations
**Content elements**: Key advantages with specific details, limitations with context

**Example**:
*"Advantages:*
*• Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses*
*• Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)*
*• Pour spout that actually works*

*Limitations:*
*- Fragile as my ego after someone criticizes my coffee technique*
*- Glass thickness suggests it was designed for a gentler universe"*

### Audience Section
**Purpose**: Help readers self-identify whether product meets their needs
**Content elements**: Specific user profiles, usage contexts where product excels/underperforms

**Example**:
*"Ideal for:*
*• Coffee enthusiasts needing precise measurements*
*• Recipe developers working with small amounts*

*Less suitable for:*
*- Households with young kids (fragile glass)*
*- Anyone cooking primarily large-batch recipes"*

## Information-Personality Balance

Framework for balancing informational content and personality in reviews:

### Baseline Ratios

- 50% informational content
- 50% personality elements
- 5% flexibility

### Personality Minimum
At least one creative element per paragraph


### Section-Specific Adjustments
- **Opening/Introduction Content**: +5% personality
- **Experience Narrative Content**: 0% adjustment (baseline)
- **Technical/Specification Content**: -15% personality
- **Evaluation Content**: -10% personality
- **Conclusion/Verdict Content**: +5% personality

### Implementation Techniques



#### Front Loading
Always place essential information FIRST in every sentence or list item

**Bad example**: *"Like upgrading from economy to business class, this battery charges quickly"*
**Good example**: *"This battery charges in under 2 hours, like upgrading from economy to business class"*

#### List Item Enhancement
Enhance 30-40% of list items with personality, always after core information

**Basic**: *"Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously"*
**Enhanced**: *"Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously, perfect for flash-addicted photographers with battery dependencies"*

#### Contextual Personality
Add personality elements that directly enhance understanding of product features

**Weak**: *"The silicone grip is good."*
**Strong**: *"The silicone grip eliminates that plastic-on-countertop clatter that wakes sleeping babies."*

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use decorative title formatting: ********** [TITLE] **********
- Create section headers with symbol prefixes: >> SECTION NAME
- Format PROS with asterisks: * Advantage description
- Format CONS with hyphens: - Limitation description
- Keep paragraphs brief (3-5 sentences) for scannability
- Use horizontal dividers (---------------) between major sections
- Limit decorative elements to 15 characters for mobile compatibility

## Keyword Implementation

Framework for incorporating search-optimized keywords in reviews:

### Placement Strategy

- **Review title/headline**: 1-2 primary keywords
  - Keep natural and benefit-focused
  - Avoid keyword stuffing

- **Opening paragraph**: Primary keywords, problem-solution keywords
  - Introduce primary keywords naturally
  - Set context with product category terms

- **Feature descriptions**: Feature keywords, technical specification terms
  - Use specific feature terminology
  - Include measurement units and specific values

- **Pros and cons section**: Feature keywords, comparison terms
  - Include key differentiating features
  - Use terminology buyers would search for

- **Verdict/summary**: Primary keywords, user-focused terms
  - Reinforce primary keywords
  - Include ideal use cases with relevant terms

### Natural Integration Techniques

- **Contextual Enhancement**: Adding useful context around keywords
  - **Awkward**: *"This 75mm lens has bokeh that is very good."*
  - **Natural**: *"This 75mm lens produces beautifully smooth bokeh that separates subjects from backgrounds effectively."*

- **Variant Usage**: Using different forms of the same keyword
  - **Repetitive**: *"The noise cancelling is great. I love the noise cancelling on flights. The noise cancelling works well."*
  - **Natural**: *"The noise cancellation is remarkably effective. I particularly appreciate how it silences engine noise on flights. The cancelling technology works consistently across various environments."*

- **Experience Integration**: Embedding keywords within experience narratives
  - **Forced**: *"The forehead thermometer is easy to use."*
  - **Natural**: *"Taking my toddler's temperature with this forehead thermometer was mercifully simple, even with a squirming child."*

## Redundancy Review

Comprehensive process for identifying and eliminating unnecessary repetition in reviews:

### Section Specialization
- Each section should serve a unique informational purpose with minimal overlap
- Information should generally appear in its most optimal section only

### Information Progression
- Later mentions of key points should typically add new dimensions rather than repeating

### Format Differentiation
- Paragraph content, list items, and tips sections should contain distinct information types
- List items should generally not be reformulations of paragraph content
- Tips should provide actionable guidance not extensively covered elsewhere

### Strategic Exceptions
- Structured lists (Pros/Cons/Features) should organize key points for scannability without extensive restatement
- Technical specifications may be presented in list format for clarity, with minimal overlap with paragraph content
- Lists should provide new presentation of information rather than simply repeating paragraph content

### Resolution Strategies

#### Optimal Placement
Identify the single best location for each piece of information
- Determine which section most logically houses each information element
- Move information to optimal section and remove from other locations
- Add brief references/callbacks rather than full repetition when needed

#### Dimension Addition
Transform repetition into valuable elaboration
- When information must appear in multiple sections, ensure each mention adds new dimension
- First mention: Basic factual information
- Second mention: Contextual significance or application
- Third mention: Comparative insight or unique perspective

**Example**:
- First mention: "The 20-second recovery time means rapid-fire stress situations require patience."
- Second mention: "Unlike my rubber banana which responds instantly, the butter stick's 20-second recovery creates a deliberate, mindful stress relief experience."

#### Phrasal Variation
Using alternative language for necessary concept repetition
- Identify concepts that must appear multiple times
- Create varied phrasings that convey same information
- Distribute varied phrasings across sections

**Example**:
- Variation 1: "Its delayed recovery after squeezing..."
- Variation 2: "The foam's 20-second reformation period..."
- Variation 3: "The pause between stress-relief sessions..."
