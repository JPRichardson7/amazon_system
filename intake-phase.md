# Intake & Questioning Phase

## Phase Overview

The Intake & Questioning phase focuses on gathering comprehensive product information before any drafting begins. This phase is the foundation for an exceptional review, as the quality of gathered information directly impacts all subsequent phases.

**Critical Requirement**: Complete information gathering before proceeding to Draft Creation phase. Review drafting must not begin until information gathering is complete.

## Objectives

- Establish complete understanding of product experience
- Identify key differentiators and unique features
- Document specific testing scenarios and outcomes
- Analyze product images for additional context
- Collect technical specifications and performance metrics
- Identify primary and secondary keywords

## Strategic Questioning Framework

A structured approach to gathering comprehensive product information efficiently:

### Question Categories

1. **Critical Gaps**: Information essential to making a purchase decision
   - Compatibility with other systems or products
   - Durability for intended primary use case
   - Key performance metrics relevant to product category

2. **Differential Gaps**: Information that reveals how this product differs from alternatives
   - Unique features not found in competing products
   - Performance differences compared to similar products
   - Design choices that distinguish from alternatives

3. **Experience Gaps**: Information about real-world usage that can't be found in product descriptions
   - How the product integrates into daily routines
   - Unexpected uses discovered during testing
   - Learning curve or adaptation period

4. **Edge Case Gaps**: Information about uncommon but important usage scenarios
   - Performance under extreme conditions
   - Adaptability to non-standard use cases
   - Failure modes and breaking points

### High-Value Questions

**Product Differentiation:**
- "What feature surprised you most about this product compared to others you've used?"
- "What does this product do better than similar products you've tried?"
- "What specific design choices make this product stand out (positively or negatively)?"

**Usage Experience:**
- "What unexpected use cases have you discovered beyond the intended purpose?"
- "How has this product changed or affected your daily routine?"
- "What specific incident best demonstrates this product's strengths or weaknesses?"

**Value Assessment:**
- "How does the price-to-performance ratio compare to alternatives?"
- "What would make this product worth paying more (or less) for?"
- "How has your perception of the product's value changed after extended use?"

**Technical Validation:**
- "How does the product perform under non-optimal conditions?"
- "What specific measurements or tests have you conducted to validate performance claims?"
- "How consistent is the product's performance across different use cases?"

### High-Risk/Reward Questions

Include one deliberately unexpected question to reveal unique insights:
- "If this product were a character in a movie, who would it be and why?"
- "What's the most ridiculous situation where you've found this product surprisingly useful?"
- "How would you modify this product if you had complete design control?"
- "What unexpected emotional response did this product trigger during use?"
- "Which seemingly unrelated product does this most remind you of in function or design?"

## Image Analysis Framework

When images are provided, extract valuable information using these categories:

### Physical Characteristics
- Visual assessment of product dimensions, materials, and build quality
- "What are the visible dimensions and proportions relative to common objects in the images?"
- "What materials and finishes are identifiable from close-up shots?"
- "Are there any visible quality indicators in the construction or assembly?"

### Usage Context
- Understanding how and where the product is used
- "What environmental context is shown in product usage photos?"
- "How does the product interact with or fit into its intended space?"
- "What complementary items or accessories are shown being used with the product?"

### Design Details
- Specific design elements and features visible in images
- "What control interfaces or adjustment mechanisms are visible?"
- "How are different components arranged or connected?"
- "What design choices are evident in the product's aesthetics?"

## Keyword Strategy

Identify and categorize key search terms during the Intake phase:

### Keyword Categories

1. **Primary Keywords**: What someone would type to find this specific product
   - Examples: '75mm lens', 'noise cancelling headphones', 'forehead thermometer'

2. **Secondary/Feature Keywords**: Specific features or benefits searchers look for
   - Examples: 'battery life', 'waterproof', 'bokeh', 'comfortable'

3. **Comparison Keywords**: Terms related to alternatives and competitors
   - Examples: 'vs Canon 75mm', 'better than Apple AirPods', 'compared to Braun'

4. **Compatibility Keywords**: Terms about what the product works with
   - Examples: 'compatible with iPhone 14', 'fits Medela pump', 'works with Xbox'

5. **Problem-Solution Keywords**: Terms related to specific pain points the product addresses
   - Examples: 'hands-free pumping', 'accurate fever reading', 'noise cancellation on airplane'

### Keyword Gathering Questions

- "What are the main competing products to this item?"
- "What traditional methods or products might this replace?"
- "What specific features would buyers be searching for in this category?"
- "What accessories or complementary products work with this item?"
- "What compatibility concerns might buyers have?"
- "What pain points does this product specifically address?"

## Information Tracking

Monitor information collection to prevent redundancy and ensure completeness:

### Categories to Track

- **Technical Specifications**: Materials, dimensions, performance metrics, compatibility information
- **User Experience**: Ease of use, learning curve, comfort, integration with routines
- **Comparative Insights**: Similar products used, relative strengths and weaknesses
- **Use Cases**: Primary intended uses, secondary applications, unexpected discoveries


### Completion Checklist

- Product specifications and technical details are complete
- User experience observations are sufficiently detailed
- Comparative insights against alternatives are documented
- Unique selling points and differentiators are identified
- Use cases and applications are thoroughly captured
- Image analysis has been completed (if applicable)
- All high-priority questions have received adequate responses
- Information is sufficient to create a comprehensive review
